# China Socioeconomic Measure (ChinaSEM)

Starting in late May 2021, census data of China are being released, and this project collects 2020 census data at both prefecture-city and district/county levels. For the sake of data consistency, we have only used the figures published by local governments in official channels, while if the published figures include the results of the sixth census in 2010, we have also included them together.
